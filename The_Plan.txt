ABSTRACT : This project is a library of tools that analyse , solve , program the equations , problems respectively.
AIM      : To devolop tools necessary for solving generic problems in Advanced mechanics and thermodynamics.
The project will be devoloped in this sequence
1. Equation manipulation library
2. Fundamental laws ,units & equations library.
3. Kinematics of bodies and machinery.
4. Rigid body dynamics of machinery.
5. Thermodynamic equations library.
6. Solid state physics.
